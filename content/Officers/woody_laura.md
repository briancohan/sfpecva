Laura has been involved with the SFPE chapter for almost 30 years. She says the education and networking at SFPE chapter meetings has been significant in increasing her job effectiveness and advancing her career. She retired in June 2016 (but continues to be involved with SFPE) after 36 years with FM Global, one of the worldâ€™s largest commercial and industrial property insurance companies. She holds a professional engineer license in fire protection, which she credits SFPE with helping her obtain.
