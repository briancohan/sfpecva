Fire-resistance-rated construction is one form of fire protection in building design and is often referred to as “passive protection.” Fire-resistance-rated building elements provide “passive” resistance to the advance of fire, as opposed to “active” fire protection systems, such as automatic sprinkler systems, which actively attempt to suppress a fire. Chapter 7 provides detailed requirements for this “passive” approach. This presentation will explore how various elements are constructed and how openings and penetrations are protected.
