Parking is available on the street and in the parking lot. Come into the building at the interior corner with the canopy right off the grassy courtyard where the brick portion meets the metal portion (see picture on page 3 along with map in attached meeting announcement). Ring doorbell on the right side to be let in and we will have someone bring you to the conference room from the main lobby.
