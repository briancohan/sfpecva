There have been some dramatic legislative changes regarding the use of firefighting foams. These changes are being driven by environmental concerns. I would like to meet with you and discuss the opportunity to present at one of your upcoming chapter meetings. The premise of the presentation that I would like to cover is as follows.

* How did this all begin: USS Forrestal incident and the creation of AFFF
* Understanding the different foam formulations: C8 - C6 - Fluorine Free
* What do end users need to be concerned about: PFOS, PFAS, PFOA
* US snap shot of firefighting foam regulations: Look at a few current State regulations and trends
* Testing methodology for PFAS in local water supplies and foam concentrates: Measuring in PPB and PPT
* Is Fluorine Free right for my application: End user must decide the fire risk and environmental risk
* Will my current hardware work with Fluorine Free foam: There are 4 areas in the system to review
* Not all Fluorine Free foams offer the same performance: Manufacturer formulations differ greatly
* What is GreenScreen: How do I know the foam I purchase is environmentally safe
* It is no longer the cost of extinguishing the fire, it is now the total fire cost?
