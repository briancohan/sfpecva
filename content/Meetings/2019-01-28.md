Subtitle: 
Special: Joint meeting with ASSE
Lunch:
Dinner: 17:00

Automated storage retrieval systems using robots powered by batteries that pull orders from tightly spaced bins limit the flue spaces and aisles that fire protection engineers are accustom to. Even though sprinkler operations can be satisfactory, final extinguishment by firefighters has proven to be difficult. Some public fire brigades have stated that they will not attempt to fight such a fire unless people are trapped in the building. These fires can be fought successfully, but they require planning. The presenter has fought such a fire as a firefighter and has also been part of numerous full-scale fire tests at UL. Insights and lessons learned will be presented.
