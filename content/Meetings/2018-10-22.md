HCT’s F-500 Encapsulator Agent’s engineered advantage is based on the high performance, three-dimensional firefighting capabilities of micelle encapsulation. This combination of attributes provides for quick knockdown and rapid heat reduction, providing permanent burnback resistance. F-500 encapsulates hydrocarbon liquids and vapors rendering fuel non-flammable and non-ignitable while interrupting free radical coalescence, inhibiting the formation of toxic soot and smoke. All of this leads to enhanced firefighting performance with increased life safety and reduced property damage while minimizing water use and the subsequent water damage and runoff.
