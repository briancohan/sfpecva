Title: About

Chapter members and meeting attendees include representatives from a wide variety of professions including engineering, consulting, insurance, fire protection contractors, and authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs).

We collaborate with other professional societies such as the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) and the American Society of Plumbing Engineers (ASPE). We also participate with the Richmond Joint Engineer’s Council to promote engineering careers to high school and middle school students.

We provide continuing education credit to attendees at our monthly meeting seminars. It is the attendee’s responsibility to verify that the seminar is appropriate to qualify as continuing education for their profession.

We welcome everyone to our meetings! Membership is not necessary to attend the meetings, but we encourage you to join and support “engineering a fire safe world”.

We are a non-profit organization.
